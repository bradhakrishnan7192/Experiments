#loading libraries
```{r}
library(lavaan)
```

Now the library is loaded, lets start with loading the data. For sample, we are going to use political democracy data
```{r}
data=PoliticalDemocracy
```

Lets see how the data looks
```{r}
head(data)
```

Now we have the data, lets start structuring the model
```{r}
model <- '  # measurement model
ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3
dem60 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4
dem65 =~ y5 + y6 + y7 + y8
# regressions yyyyy
dem60 ~ ind60
dem65 ~ ind60 + dem60
# residual correlations
y1 ~~ y5
y2 ~~ y4 + y6
y3 ~~ y7
y4 ~~ y8
y6 ~~ y8
'
```

Now the model is structured, lets start fitting the model and summarizing the results
```{r}
fit <- sem(model, data=PoliticalDemocracy)
summary(fit, standardized=TRUE)
```
